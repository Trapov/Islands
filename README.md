# Islands
just a task to count all islands

## Task
Given a boolean 2D matrix, find the number of islands. 
A group of connected 1s forms an island.
For example, the below matrix contains 3 islands

```csharp
Input : new[,] 
            {
                {0,0,0,0,1,1},
                {0,1,0,0,1,0},
                {0,1,1,0,1,1},
                {1,1,1,0,0,0},
                {0,0,0,1,1,0},
                {1,0,0,1,1,0},
            };
Output : 3
```

This is an variation of the standard problem: “Counting number of connected components in a undirected graph”.
